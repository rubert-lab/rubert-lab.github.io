	<p>I have a passion for digital, specifically finding ways to utilize data to customize and enhance experience. I like to think that I am both data-driven and art-inspired. I believe that if you are not failing from time to time, you are not being innovative enough.
	Outside of my work I love sports and I am passionate anything Australia!
